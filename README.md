# Windows-11-cleanup
A PowerShell script I run when I setup a new install of Windows 11. Disables telemetry and brings back the old right-click menu

Before you run this, open up PowerShell as administrator and run

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Once this is done, cd to the directory where the script is located and run it.
